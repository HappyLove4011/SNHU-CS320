**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**
I write lots of tests that try to break my code. I check for edge cases, like what happens if someone tries to use a super long name or a duplicate ID. I also build rules directly into the code, like not allowing a blank phone number, to keep the data safe and correct.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**
I look at the requirements like a checklist. If the requirements say "the contact ID can't be longer than 10 characters," I make sure my code enforces that rule and I write a test to prove it. This keeps me focused on building what the user actually asked for.

**How do I approach designing software?**
I break the big problem into smaller, manageable parts (like having separate files for the Contact and the Service). I also think about how I will test a feature before I even write it. This helps me write cleaner code that's easier to fix and improve later on.
